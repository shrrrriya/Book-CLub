## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads on changes and shows lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation.** See CRA docs for details.
