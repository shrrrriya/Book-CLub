ðŸ“š Book-CLub

âœ¨ Welcome to Book-CLub â€” a cozy little corner of the internet for book lovers to search, discover, and explore their next great read.

ðŸŒŸ What does it do?

At Book-CLub, you can search for books by title, author, or keywords and quickly find what youâ€™re looking for. Each book comes with details like its cover, author, and description, so you can decide if itâ€™s the one for your reading list.

The design is simple and clean, powered by React, so the focus always stays on the books. And while the app is fetching your results, youâ€™ll see a smooth little loader to keep things pleasant.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads on changes and shows lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation.** See CRA docs for details.
